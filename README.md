NoVQMRA MC Tomato v1, NoVQMRA MC Raspberry v1, and NoVQMRA MC Lettuce v1 each contain commodity-specific code for generating human norovirus infection risks to a consumer. Within this code, you can modulate the likelihood of the harvester and/or packer being norovirus infected, use of gloves, use of handwashing, and level of handwashing (i.e. 2log, 3log, 4log virus removal efficiency) etc. The following files expand upon this code and extends from one commodity to 1-10 serially harvested commodities NoVQMRA MC Tomato 1-10 v1, NoVQMRA MC Raspberry 1-10 v1, and NoVQMRA MC Lettuce 1-10 v1. 

This QMRA base model code has been used to characterize human norovirus contamination of fresh produce (raspberries, tomato, and lettuce) and risk to a consumer. We also simulate individual and combined risk mitigation strategies based on the FDA's food safety modernization act (FSMA) including hand hygiene and partial worker furlough among food workers in a fresh produce harvest and production setting, please refer to and cite this publication: Sobolik, J.
